# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. 

These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by itself.

Unsupervised machine learning models can be utilized for two main tasks, clustering and association. 

- Clustering:
    - Clustering is a data mining technique which groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. Clustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information.
- Association:
    - An association rule is a rule-based method for finding relationships between variables in a given dataset.

Common types of unsupervised learning include:
- K-Means Clustering
- Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
