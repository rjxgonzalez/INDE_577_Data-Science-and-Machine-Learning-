# INDE 577 (Data Science and Machine Learning)
**Instructor:** Randy R. Davila

**Student:** Ricardo Gonzalez

**Semester:** Spring 2022

**##Course Description:**

This data science course taught at Rice University covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. It implements many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch, but will also make use of the Skikit-Learn and Tensorflow libraries. 

**##Repository Description:**

This respository was created by Ricardo Gonzalez, a graduate student pursuing a Professional Science Master's degree in Space Studies at Rice University. It contains a collection of machine learning algorithms for the industiral engineering course INDE 577 (Data Sciecnce and Machine Learning). In this repository, there will be sub-repositories named by an algorithm (e.g., perceptron), and each contains a .ipynb file which demonstrates and implements the algorithm learned throughtout the semester, a ReadME file, and sub-repositories of the respective dataset(s) and image(s)
