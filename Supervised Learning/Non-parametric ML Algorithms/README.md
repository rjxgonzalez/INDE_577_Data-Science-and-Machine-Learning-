# Non-parametric ML Algorithms

Non-parametric algorithms do not make strong assumptions about the form of the mapping fucntions. They do not accept a specific form of mapping function between input and output data as true. Moreover, non-parametic models can be used in either classification or regression problems. 

Common non-parametics models include: 

- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Learning
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
