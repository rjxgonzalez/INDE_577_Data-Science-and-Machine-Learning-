# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is defined by the use of labeled datasets to train algoritms that classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately.
This subcatergory of machine learning uses a training set to "teach" models to produce desired output(s). The training dataset includes input and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through a loss (or error) function, where it will adjust until the error is sufficiently minimized. 

Supervised machine learning can be split into two types of problems, classification and regression. 

- Classification:
    - Classification uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are perceptron and, despite the name, logistic regression. 

- Regression:
    - Regression invesitgates the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (outcome).  

However, it is important to note non-parametric algorithms. These algorithms do not make strong assumptions about the form of the mapping fucntions. They do not accept a specific form of mapping function between input and output data as true. Moreover, non-parametic models can be used in either classification or regression problems.
