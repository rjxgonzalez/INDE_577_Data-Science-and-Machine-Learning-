# Regression

Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It's used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.

Regression analysis is used to understand the relationship between different independent variables  and a dependent variable or outcome. Models that are trained to forecast or predict trends and outcomes will be trained using regression techniques. These models will learn the relationship between input and output data from labelled training data. It can then forecast future trends or predict outcomes from unseen input data, or be used to understand gaps in historic data. 

Typical regression algorithms include

- Linear Regression
- Neural Networks
- Random Forests
